<h1>Rocketseat Waffle Recipe Challenge</h1>
<p>This repository hosts my result of the Waffle Recipe practical challenge by Rocketseat.</p>
<p>It runs in a Node.JS Express server, so you will need to have Node.JS installed. Also don't forget to run the install command on the root directory:</p>
<pre>npm install</pre>
<p>In case if you want to make the app run outside a Node.JS server you can just rip the static folder and treat the files on another environment.</p>
<p>To execute the server, run the following command:</p>
<pre>npm start</pre>
<p>Once that's done, the server should start normally. The default port is 3333, so go to your localhost address as following:</p>
<pre>http://localhost:3333/</pre>
<p>That's it. Feel free to edit this piece of code if you want. ðŸ‘‹</p>
